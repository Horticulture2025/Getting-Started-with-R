A hands-on tutorial for learning R programming basics, perfect for first-time users. This guide covers essential R skills including working directories, data manipulation, visualization, and file management.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Setting up and managing working directories
- Creating and manipulating simple datasets
- Generating various types of plots (scatter, bar, histogram, box plots)
- Saving outputs to specific directories
- Basic data analysis and statistics

## 📁 Repository Structure
# Directory management
getwd()                    # Get current working directory
setwd("path/to/folder")    # Set working directory
dir.create("outputs")      # Create new directory

# Data creation
data.frame()               # Create data frames
sample()                   # Random sampling

# Plotting
plot()                     # Scatter plots
barplot()                  # Bar charts
hist()                     # Histograms
boxplot()                  # Box plots
abline()                   # Add lines to plots

# File operations
write.csv()                # Save data to CSV
png()                      # Save plots as PNG
dev.off()                  # Close graphics device

# Data analysis
summary()                  # Summary statistics
cor()                      # Correlation
aggregate()                # Group-wise calculations
